# CaresApp

The Cares application is for sure my biggest project 
that I started, it is my "Final Paper", a work that with 
absolute certainty was the one that most used my capacity 
because it was a new sea that I was entering, I had 
never even heard about dart, not even flutter, but little 
by little I was learning about them.

Cares has as its main objective the facilitation of the 
search of convalescents for caregivers in nearby regions, being 
possible to search by "Neighborhood, City", finding the 
caregiver that suits you best, it will be possible to 
visualize his/her number and thus call him/her to have a 
better conversation about prices and expedient.

The app has a separate registration function, for those 
who will be caregivers or for those who will be convalescents 
in the application, an authentication system by phone number, login 
screen (password change is possible), Home Page which 
leads to the Search Page (screen to search for caregivers), Profile Page 
to view the profile, Settings Page with the functions 
being: Password change, Notifications Screen, Cares privacy and security screen, 
the bug reporting and feedback screens and finally a place to 
log out and thus leaving the account and ending the cycle.

The spoken software is very complete and was used about 3-4 months 
to be completely done, was one of my biggest 
challenges, but that made me love what I study, the 
programming, so I just have to thank the videos and friends 
who helped me in my journey and that there will come even 
more marathons to be completed!
